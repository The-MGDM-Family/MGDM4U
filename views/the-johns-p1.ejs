<div class="story-body">
  <p>It was 8 am in the morning. The sun was shining high. The John-ny brothers are studying about the magical treasure Island, to which many of them have gone and never came back. It was like a mystery Island, no one knew about it and people who knew about it are still a missing mystery themselves.</p>
  <p>Introducing you to the twenty year old twins Carter John and Crater John. They were born in April 2002. Carter was interested in History and Mystery  and Crater was interested in Physics and Computing, he takes his laptop everywhere.</p>
  <p>Carter asked, "Do you have any coordinates of the island?". Crater said, "No idea.". Their Mom called them, "Johnnys, Please come for Breakfast. Or I'll have to come with a stick". Carter and Crater together replied, "Okay Mom". Without waiting for a second Carter said "Jinx. Do not speak until someone calls your name thrice or else I'll pinch or punch you thrice or more". They both went together.</p>
  <p>Crater said, "Good morning" along with Carter to their parents forgetting that he was in Jinx. Carter then pinched him thrice and with each pinch he said, "Ow". In the middle of the breakfast their dad asked, "What are you researching about? I found a lot of papers lying everywhere when I came to your room looking for you guys". Carter replied, "It's about the new assignment given by our history teacher for these holidays, we might be having to go to the Island we are researching about very soon". Dad replied, "Give me the coordinates and we'll come with you". Carter remembered something and ran up stairs. He took a book full of nothing but an image saying, "The Time of birth = The Coordinates of the Island". Crater also followed him into their room. He asked, "Why did you not finish your breakfast". Carter, without replying, handed the book to him. Crater curiously asked, "You got the coordinates? And Why are some letters in caps?". Carter dragged him downstairs to their parents and said without fear, "Mom and Dad, The Island is not for History assignment, it's a Treasure Island. Will you allow us to go there, You can also come with us". Dad replied, "We have to think?". The twins thought they were going to reject it but fortunately this time 'Expect the Unexpected'. Their parents told them, "We'll go. Let's see what really happens".</p>
  <p>Day 1: Carter researched about the book's writer's Birthday. He found that and said, "Crater, He was born on 29th of February 1922. Yes, I know, Unlucky right? He can celebrate his birthday only once in four years". Crater said, "Ha Ha! Tell me later, I'll laugh". Our next clue must be in 29°02'N 19°22'E - Ajdabiya, Libya, Africa or 02°29'N 19°22'E - Budjala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. They can only be our next clues because they both are not Islands."</p>
  <p>Day 3: 'Tinggg - Tonggg' The bell rang. Carter lazily asked his twin bro to open the door. Crater stared at him for a second and executed the order. Down he went and opened the door to receive the courier which had their passports. Crater was stunned at that second, Dad came and said, "I heard what you were talking". Carter came down, "Now, I heard what you were talking". They both thanked their Dad and went upstairs.</p>
  <p>Two hours later, they both came back down and said, "We have two places in the next-clue list. We thought of going to Ajdabiya first since it is a dessert, it has greater chances". Dad replied, "You'll get your ride on Sunday". Crater asked, "You? So you're not coming? Ride? So it is going to be on Private plane?". Dad replied, "Yep, Yep, Yep, and Nope 'cause your goin' in a helicopter". Carter said, "Crater, we're going to a dessert there ain't goin' to be any airports".</p>
  <p>Day 5: It's Sunday, Both the Johns are ready for the ride. Their Mom asked, "Aren't you carrying any luggage". Carter said, "We are going on an adventure not a tour. We can't carry our luggage everywhere". The helicopter was ready in their big backyard. Yes you are correct, they are a very rich family.</p>
  <p>They were above the dessert they were looking for the clue. They saw something black. They told to land the helicopter down and wait there. The black thing was a person. When he saw them, he just ran off. They tried to stop him, but he didn't. Carter asked, "Crater, did you notice?". Crater replied, "Notice what? The way he ran". Carter stared at him and said, "That place was soft but this place is hard". Crater digged a little bit and there was a road. They tracked the road, it was a long one and at the end of it was a godown. They went in and found a small box. It had a keyhole. Carter thought for a second and took the book in which he saw the first clue. There was a very hard button on the book which Carter pressed and found a key inside a compartment in the book. He tried to open the box and it did. It had a map of an Island which had a treasure point which they thought where the treasure was in. They didn't know where the Island was but one thing for sure - there is a treasure and it is on an island.</p>
  <p>Day 6: They went to the other place which is Budjala. It was full of deciduous forests. They saw a cave and landed the helicopter nearby on a rough place with much difficulty. Crater drew lines with invisible paint as they were going in. They went deep into the cave and found a segment which was bright because of an opening in the top. It was the end of the cave. All the sunlight was focused on one point. Carter dug a little bit in that point and found another box with a keyhole. He took the book and found another button on the book and pressed it. He took the key and opened the box. It had a map leading to a park in New York and another key inside. "So this is how it is?" Crater asked. They didn't know the way out and it was dark. There was a light glowing. Crater said, "The invisible paint glows in the dark". Carter replied, "Great idea".</p>
  <p>Day 7: They went to the park in New York. They looked around and found a closed place named 'African treasure-hunt'. It was closed for maintenance and repair work, there were a lot of tools and equipment lying all around. Most probably the crew was away due to lack of funds and hence the program would have been dropped. They told their driver to watch out if someone might follow. The twins alone went into the Treasure Hunt game. There were a lot of clues which finally led to the so-called treasure hidden in that place. They found the treasure box but this one was a little big, a lot bigger and it was already open but empty. They found a keyhole in a corner on the floor of the open box. Carter took the key they found in Budjala and opened it. The whole floor of the box opened outwards. They looked around and found a ladder and used it to go down. They landed on a very rough floor in a dark room and looked around. They thought they saw sunlight but there was a hole in the end of that room. One wall in the room had some information engraved on it, Carter tried to copy all of them in a book but he found that the book had the same information written with the invisible ink that Crater used to find the way out in Budjala. It was the same book which had the keys and the first clue. He showed that to Crater. Crater said, "Some magic? Everytime we saw the book, we used a light to find at least some hidden information". Suddenly a loud sound was heard, the ladder fell down and the floor of the box through which they came in had closed. Crater now said, "What kind of magic?". Crater called the helicopter driver using his phone and stood near the hole where he got a signal and asked him to take the key from the hole but he said he didn't need a key to open a lock, so they just told him the way to reach them. He came and opened the way out and Carter put the ladder again and went up, Crater said, “Wait don’t leave me!” and after going up he said, “Carter, Only we are old school, Everyone else has upgraded”.They all went to their helicopter and started reading the Information. They found the approximate location of the Island.</p>
  <p>Day 8: They were flying over an ocean and guess what? The Island is not anywhere else, it is in the Bay of Bengal and Yes it is a part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The approximate coordinates of the Island is 13°32’N 92°53’E. They found the Island but they didn’t know the place of the treasure. The island was full of forests. They hardly had any space to land the helicopter. They landed the Helicopter near a very big Banyan tree. They used the map they found in Ajdabiya. It led them to a tree with a door. They tried to open it, but it didn't, They tried to break it, but it didn't. So Crater took one of his newest inventions which he named as the space-filler. It has a metal in liquid form which turns into solid after pressing a button. He made it in the shape of a key and opened the door. The driver and Carter congratulated him and Carter said, “Only I am old school” with an impression in I. They went down using a ladder.</p>
  <p>The place was narrow and had black matte-finished walls.The next step they took, a sword came flying. Crater asked, “Should we really go this way? Isn’t there any other way to go?” in a horrified way. Carter replied, “If it was easy, It wouldn’t be a treasure-hunt or I wouldn’t have come”. Crater yelled at him in Gibberish. Crater told Carter to open Chapter 22 - page 85 - The struggle to the treasure in the book. Carter opened the page and said, “Wow! Someone has an interest in this but you should’ve told this before because it has info about the flying sword”. Crater said, “It’s a Do or Die situation, so I had to remember it”. Carter said, “The next obstacle is an arrow walk Luckily we have how-to-reach-the-end-alive”. They followed the rules as it is in the book. The next obstacle was slicing blades and they were told to stand in between the lines in which the sharp blades will come. The next one was swallowing sand and it said to walk on the edges of the floor where the sand was absent. And That’s it they have reached the end of the book and the treasure cave. Crater asked, “Where is the treasure?”. Carter replied, “I-I-I am not sure. Like the book has ended as well as the way”.</p>
  <p>They waited there for a few minutes and Crater went and lit a flame-torch. He found something different in the wall when the light touched the wall. He asked, “Carter, You still have the UV torch, right? Can you pass it?”. Carter then passed the UV torch to him. Crater hit the UV light in the wall and called Carter to see this amazing thing. They saw an arrow which pointed to a human-sized box. There was a dot to the east side of the box and above it was written ‘PRESS HERE’. Carter pressed in the dot. The wall along the line of the box went in and some air went in due to air pressure which blew the fire in the flame-torch. Now also the room was empty. Crater said, “What? It-It’s Empty, but why?”. Carter said, “No, look there”, He pointed at a place using the UV light. There was a rectangular box. Carter said, “Give me the book”. Crater replied, “What book? Oh that one, One second”. Carter kept the book in the hole and pushed it in. The door through which they came in, closed and a new door in front of them opened and again due to air pressure, a force pulled them inside and closed the door. They woke up and guess what? Yes, They finally found the treasure. The treasure room was as big as half of a football stadium. The driver congratulated both of them for finding the treasure. Carter couldn’t be in a place because of his happiness but Carter put one rule, ‘No one touches any of the treasures’. Crater took a beautiful dagger that was clean and sharp which made him disobey the one and only rule of Carter. They found a ladder going up in the end of the treasure room. They went up in it and it led to the top of the banyan tree near which they landed their helicopter. Carter said, “I didn’t expect this”. It was night so they slept in the helicopter.</p>
  <p>Day 9: The driver and Crater woke up but Carter didn’t. Crater was playing with his dagger and suddenly a little bit of the bottom of the handle came down. He tried to open the bottom and there was a blue 8GB pen drive inside it. Crater thought, “These treasures must be some 100 years old but pen drives aren’t that old, mostly someone else kept it there recently”. He plugged it in his Laptop and it had only one file which was a pdf. He read its name and shut down the laptop and kept everything back safe.</p>
  <p>They reached home safely and everyone went in. When they told their parents that they found the treasure, their parents asked, “Then where is it?”. Carter replied, “They don’t even go for a single rupee but they are very important to Indian History, So we didn’t touch them”. Dad said, “Very much proud of you two”. Crater, after a few minutes, took Dad to his room and explained about the dagger, the pen drive in the dagger, and the pdf in the pen drive. Dad asked, “Show me the pdf”. Crater took his laptop and showed him the pdf. It was about something great. Dad asked him to take a printout of it. He took the printout and stapled it and wrapped it with gift wrap. Crater and Dad went out and gave this as a gift to Carter. He opened it and read the title out loud, “From Surface to the Core”.</p>
